# Street-View-House-Numbers
A street view house numbers recognition system trained on the SVHN data set by Google Street View images. The data set can be found at: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/ I used the .mat files aka "Format 2" of the given data set as found on the given link.

This project was also the capstone in the Coursera course - [Getting Started with TensorFlow 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/getting-started-with-tensor-flow2/home/welcome)

I have used TensorFlow 2 here and provided complete documentation in the Jupyter Notebook. Thanks to Google Colab for providing free GPU!
